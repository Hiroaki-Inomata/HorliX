## HorliX (horos branch)

### OverView

HorliX is a DICOM Viewer based on Horos/OsiriX.  
The origin of HorliX is HorosJ which is a japanese version of Horos published in github. One day air-h-128k-il, one of the contributors of HorosJ and Horos projects, changed his source codes in order to run HorosJ/Horos under full 64bit mode.  
It was when HorliX came into the world.  
Now HorliX has several features apart from Horos and/or OsiriX Lite:  
  
- fully 64bit software including libralies  
- User Friendly UI(for exampl, ROI-color-roatation-UI)
-  and so on  
  
 ‘HorliX’ was named after not only Horos/OsiriX but also ‘Horlicks’ , a female legendary race horse in NZ.
